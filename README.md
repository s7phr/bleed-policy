# Bleed Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** June 9th, 2024  
**Last Updated:** June 9th, 2024  

Thank you for using Bleed, a multi-purpose Discord bot designed to enhance server security, provide protection against potential threats, and deliver timely alerts. This Privacy Policy explains how Bleed collects, uses, and protects your information, particularly focusing on message usage.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Message Content

Bleed accesses message content within the servers it is added to. This includes messages sent by users, both in public channels and private channels where the bot has access.

## 2. How We Use Message Content

### Content Moderation

Bleed scans messages in real-time to detect and delete inappropriate content, spam, and potential threats. This helps maintain a safe and welcoming environment for all server members.

### Automated Response System

Bleed processes message content to provide automated responses and engage in conversations based on specific keywords or commands. This includes providing information, answering queries, and executing commands issued by members.

### Custom Alerts and Triggers

Bleed uses message content to set up custom alerts and triggers. For example, it can notify admins if certain keywords are mentioned or if a potential threat is detected.

### Interaction Logs and Analytics

Bleed analyzes message content to generate interaction logs and analytics, helping server admins understand member interactions, popular topics, and engagement levels. This data is valuable for community management and growth strategies.

### Advanced Anti-Spam Measures

Bleed uses message content analysis to implement advanced anti-spam measures, such as detecting repetitive messages, links, and potential phishing attempts, ensuring the server remains secure.

## 3. Data Protection and Security

### Data Storage

Message content accessed by Bleed is temporarily processed in real-time and is not stored permanently. Any logs or analytics generated from message content are anonymized and do not contain identifiable personal information.

### Data Sharing

Bleed does not share any collected message content with third parties. All data processing occurs within the confines of the server where Bleed is installed.

### Security Measures

We implement robust security measures to protect the data processed by Bleed, including encryption, secure access protocols, and regular security audits.

## 4. User Control and Data Deletion

### Opting Out

Server admins can control Bleed’s access to message content by adjusting the bot’s permissions or removing the bot from the server entirely.

### Data Deletion

Upon request, server admins can ask for the deletion of any interaction logs or analytics generated by Bleed. These requests can be made through our support channels.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
